# PyBer Analysis
Analysis and Visualization for Rideshare with Matplotlib

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify rideshare patterns across city types for Pyper, a rideshare company. This data, compiled over four months in 2019, can help the company maximize their profits and implement more effective strategy across rural, suburban, and urban cities. 

After cleaning and merging the key data sources (information regarding rides and drivers), the data was gathered, compiling variables (Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares) by city type. By calculating the Average Fare/Ride, Average Fare/Driver, and the totals by date and city, we visualized this data in tables and line plots. The line graph provides an indicator of the profitability across city types.

## Results
The figure below illustrates the five indicators of rideshare experience between rural, suburban, and urban cities between January to May 2019.

### All Results by City Type

**Rural**: In rural areas, while the number of riders and drivers are substantially lower than suburban and urban areas, the average fare per ride and driver are higher. Due to the low number of rides, the Total Fares in rural cities is the lowest. Presumably, due to the decreased demand, there are less drivers and the limited number must have high enough rates to maintain a presence in the area. There could be other factors involved, like average distance tranveled. 

**Suburban**: Suburban areas are very midrange in this analysis and illustrate the other patterns we see in rural and suburban areas. As the number of riders and drivers decrease, the average fare for ride and driver increase. This is evident as total rides are 40% of those in urban cities and suburban drivers make up 20% of the total number of urban drivers but are only half the total fares as urban fares. 

**Urban**: Urban cities have the highest supply of riders and drivers, resulting in the highest total fares. That said, urban cities have the lowest average fares per ride and driver. This indicates that though there may be an increased demand or regularity in which city dwellers are using a rideshare company, the lower averages for fares may be due to the distance tranveled (generally less than rural and suburban), affordability, and additional factors not included in this analysis (base fare, additional taxes, etc.)

### Total Fare by City Type
Similar to our analysis above, from January to May 2019, urban cities have the highest total fare while rural cities have the lowest.

## Summary
Based on our analysis, I recommend the following to address disparities between rural, suburban, and urban areas:

 1. **Incentivize urban drivers to offer rides in the suburbs.** Based on the findings, there is an increase (potentially a surplus) of drivers in urban areas, despite the lower price per ride. We recommend providing incentives for urban drivers to drive in more suburban areas. This will increase the availability, which may spur more customers to use the rideshare app due to the ease of access. This will delevelop customer loyalty with infrequent users and increase demand long term.
 2. **Have at least one dedicated driver in rural areas.** By incentivizing at least one driver in a rural area (a guaranteed salary regardless of number of fares), this will increase the presence and accessibility of PyPer in rural areas. As rural residents get used to the availabilty, likely the demand will increase. 
 3. **Limit the number of drivers in urban areas during certain times of day.** Because of the accessibility of PyPer, we recommend creating more demand for the product which will increase the fare amount. PyPer can do further analysis identifying the average riders per day and per hour in urban citites. Then take that average number of riders and cap the number of drivers for optimum profitability.
